### Overview

This architecture diagram outlines the workflow of the Patent Analysis Project. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Data Source**: Extract patent data from diverse sources using web scraping techniques, specifically with Beautiful Soup and Selenium.
  
2. **Load Data**: Import the extracted data into a MongoDB database for efficient storage and retrieval.
  
3. **Transform Data**: Utilize Apache Spark, particularly PySpark, to standardize and analyze the data from different sources, creating a unified dataset for comprehensive analysis.
  
4. **Reload Data**: Store the transformed data back into MongoDB Cloud for further accessibility and analysis.
  
5. **Visualize Data**: Create engaging visualizations using Power BI and Tableau to present the findings effectively.
  
6. **Integrate Flask**: Develop a user-friendly web application that manages user interactions, utilizing MySQL as the backend database for seamless data management.
