            <td>Eine Verbrennungskraftmaschine mit elektrischem Ausgang nach dem Stand der Technik besteht aus einem Verbrennungsmotor mit Pleuel, Kurbelwelle, Schwungscheibe und einem elektrischen Generator. Das Ziel der vorgeschlagenen Anordnung ist es, den mechanischen Aufbau auf ein Minimum zu reduzieren und den Wirkungsgrad zu verbessern. Die Lösung des Problems beruht auf einer Weiterentwicklung des bekannten Freikolbenprinzips, bei dem der Kolben nur durch eine Gasdruckfeder in Resonanz geführt wird. Die Lösung vereinfacht den mechanischen Aufbau mit einer Kolbenmaschine (1) dadurch, dass sie den sowieso vorhandenen elektrischen Generator (2) so bemisst und mit einer Steuereinheit (3) steuert, dass er eine zur Führung des Kolbens im Generator- und Motorbetrieb ausreichende Kraft ausübt und so eine Gasdruckfeder samt ihren Nachteilen überflüssig macht. Darüber hinaus wird die Bewegung des Kolbens (5) frei gestaltbar und nicht durch eine Resonanz oder Schwungscheibe starr vorgegeben. Gegenüber den starren Führungen sind damit Freiheitsgrade wie die Festlegung der Kolbengeschwindigkeit für einen optimalen Verbrennungsablauf im Arbeitstakt, Takte unterschiedlicher Dauer nach den Erfordernissen der Prozesse und ein variabler Hubraum nutzbar, die einer bisher unbekannten Optimierung der Vier- und Zweitaktprinzipien dienen. Als absolute Neuheit ist damit auch ein erfindungsgemäßer Dreitakt-Betrieb möglich, der neben den Takten Verdichten und Arbeiten als dritten Takt einen Pausentakt aufweist, während dem bei ruhendem Kolben das Ausstoßen und die Füllung mit Frischluft erfolgen. Er erspart die Kolbenbewegung zum Ausstoßen und Füllen. Dazu werden Anordnungen auf der Basis des in der Zeichnung dargestellten Schemas beschrieben, bei denen die mechanischen Aufwendungen minimiert sind und mehr die im Zuge der Elektrifizierung und Digitalisierung des Autos kostengünstig werdenden Technologien der elektrischen Maschinen, Leistungselektronik, Speicherung, Hard- und Software zum Einsatz kommen. Als Anwendungsgebiet bieten sich vorteilhaft Kraftfahrzeuge mit Hybridantrieb wie HEV (Hybrid Electric Vehicle) und PHEV (Plug-in Electric Vehicle) sowie mit Elektrische Fahrzeuge mit Batterie BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) an. Des weiteren sind damit wartungsarme und langlebige Anordnungen zur Kraft-Wärme-Kopplung im mobilen wie stationären Betrieb hervorragend zu gestalten.</td>

Die Ladespeicher übernehmen die Akku-Segmente in Aufzug-ähnlich untereinander befindlichen Steckplätzen, die in mehreren Bereichen nebeneinander platziert sind. Eine Bedienung mit Tastern ermöglicht den Wechsel der Steckplätze vor je einem Bedienungsfenster in der Frontplatte des Ladespeichers, wobei die genaue Information über die Akkus und deren Zustand mittels elektronischer Anzeigen erfolgt. In Rechnung gestellt wird nicht nur das Entgelt der Energie-Inhalte, sondern auch einen Anteil als Leihgebühr für die Akku-Segmente, da diese nicht direkt zum E-Auto gehören.</td>

The battery pop-up device for the electric vehicle comprises a shell and an elastic body. The shell is installed in an installation hole of an outer battery protective shell. The elastic body is arranged in the shell and can push one end of the shell, the shell is made to move in the axial direction of the installation hole, and one end of the shell is made to protrude out of the surface of the outer battery protective shell. According to the battery pop-up device for the electric vehicle, when a battery case is inserted into the outer battery protective shell, the battery case pushes the shell to move inwards in the axial direction of the installation hole, the elastic body in the shell is compressed, and when the elastic body is compressed to an appropriate extent, the battery case is locked through a battery lock cylinder; when the battery case is taken out, the battery cylinder is opened, the elastic body rebounds under the action of the elastic force of the elastic body, the shell is pushed to move outwards in the axial direction of the installation hole, the battery case is driven to pop up for a certain distance, and then the battery case is convenient to pull out; therefore, the problem that when the battery case of the electric vehicle is replaced or a battery is replaced with another, the battery case is difficult to pull is solved.</td>

During start-up and a run-up of the oil pump (19), the BLDC motor is operated with feedforward-controlled excitation in order to heat an oil conveyed by the oil pump (19), until the oil has a kinematic viscosity which allows closed-loop-controlled operation of the BLDC motor above a motor-specific limit rotational speed of a rotor of the BLDC motor. Waste heat produced by the BLDC motor as a result of the feedforward control is radiated to the oil in the surroundings of the oil pump (19). Said feedforward control is temporarily interrupted in order to sense a voltage induced by the rotor in the unexcited coils of a stator of the BLDC motor. Above the limit rotational speed of the rotor, a rotor position and a rotor (angular) velocity can be determined with sufficient accuracy by means of said voltage. Above said limit rotational speed, after it has been sensed that said limit rotational speed has been exceeded, a switchover to operation of the BLDC motor with closed-loop-controlled excitation is made. A computer program, a computer program product, a heat-transfer-medium system and a vehicle are also proposed.</td>
