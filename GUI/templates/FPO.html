                            some prominent features are described herein. Details of one or more implementations of the
                            subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings
                            and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages will become apparent from
                            the description, the drawings, and the claims. Note that the relative dimensions of the
                            following figures may not be drawn to scale. One aspect of the subject matter described in
                            the disclosure provides an electric vehicle battery system. The electric vehicle battery
                            system includes a plurality of electric vehicle battery modules connected in parallel. Each
                            electric vehicle battery module includes a battery. In certain non-limiting embodiments, the
                            battery can be implemented as a combination of individual cells arranged in series, parallel
                            or a combination of series and parallel. Each electric vehicle battery module also includes
                            a balancing circuit in electrical communication with a current path from the battery to an
                            electric vehicle battery module output node. Each electric vehicle battery module also
                            includes a current sensor in electromagnetic communication with the current path between the
                            battery and the balancing circuit. The current sensor can be configured to sense a current
                            level between the battery and the balancing circuit. The balancing circuit can be configured
                            to balance the current level sensed by the current sensor of each electric vehicle battery
                            module. Another aspect of the subject matter described in the disclosure provides a method
                            of operating an electric vehicle battery system. The method includes monitoring a first
                            current level using a first current sensor at a first current path between a first battery
                            and an electric vehicle battery module output node. The method also includes balancing the
                            first current level at the first current path using a first balancing circuit in electrical
                            communication with the first current path based upon the first current level. The first
                            current sensor, first battery and first balancing circuit can be part of a first electric
                            vehicle battery module. The method also includes monitoring a second current level using a
                            second current sensor at a second current path between a second battery and the electric
                            vehicle battery module output node. The method also includes balancing the second current
                            level at the second current path using a second balancing circuit in electrical
                            communication with the second current path based upon the second current level. The second
                            current sensor, second battery and second balancing circuit can be part of a second electric
                            vehicle battery module. Also, the first electric vehicle battery module and second electric
                            battery module can be connected in parallel with each other at the electric vehicle battery
                            module output node.

                        <td>It is in this context that embodiments of the invention arise. Embodiments are described
                            with reference to methods and systems for providing auxiliary charging mechanisms that can
                            be integrated or coupled to a vehicle, to supplement the main battery of a vehicle. The
                            auxiliary charging mechanism can be in the form of an auxiliary battery compartment that can
                            receive a plurality of charged batteries. The auxiliary battery compartment can be charged
                            without the vehicle, and can be installed or placed in the vehicle to provide supplemental
                            charge to the vehicles main battery. Thus, if the main battery becomes drained/used, the
                            auxiliary battery compartment, having a plurality of charged batteries, can resume providing
                            charge to the vehicle. In one embodiment, the auxiliary battery compartment is configured to
                            hold a plurality of smaller batteries, referred to herein as “volt bars.” A volt bar should
                            also be interchangeably viewed to be a “charge unit.” The charge unit is a physical
                            structure that holds charge, as does a battery. A charge unit can also be a fraction of
                            charge, which may be contained in a physical structure. Broadly speaking, a volt bar is a
                            battery that can be inserted into an auxiliary battery carrier. The auxiliary battery
                            carrier, or compartment, can be lifted by human and placed into a vehicle, such as the trunk
                            of the vehicle. The auxiliary charging carrier can then be removed from the vehicle to
                            provide charge to the volt bars contained within the auxiliary battery carrier. For
                            instance, owners of electric vehicles can purchase an auxiliary battery carrier and fill the
                            auxiliary battery carrier with a plurality of volt bars.

                        <td>It is in this context that embodiments of the invention arise. Embodiments are described
                            with reference to methods and systems for providing auxiliary charging mechanisms that can
                            be integrated or coupled to a vehicle, to supplement the main battery of a vehicle. The
                            auxiliary charging mechanism can be in the form of an auxiliary battery compartment that can
                            receive a plurality of charged batteries. The auxiliary battery compartment can be charged
                            without the vehicle, and can be installed or placed in the vehicle to provide supplemental
                            charge to the vehicles main battery. Thus, if the main battery becomes drained/used, the
                            auxiliary battery compartment, having a plurality of charged batteries, can resume providing
                            charge to the vehicle. In one embodiment, the auxiliary battery compartment is configured to
                            hold a plurality of smaller batteries, referred to herein as “volt bars.” A volt bar should
                            also be interchangeably viewed to be a “charge unit.” The charge unit is a physical
                            structure that holds charge, as does a battery. A charge unit can also be a fraction of
                            charge, which may be contained in a physical structure. Broadly speaking, a volt bar is a
                            battery that can be inserted into an auxiliary battery carrier. The auxiliary battery
                            carrier, or compartment, can be lifted by human and placed into a vehicle, such as the trunk
                            of the vehicle. The auxiliary charging carrier can then be removed from the vehicle to
                            provide charge to the volt bars contained within the auxiliary battery carrier. For
                            instance, owners of electric vehicles can purchase an auxiliary battery carrier and fill the
                            auxiliary battery carrier with a plurality of volt bars.

                        <td>The Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is similar to the PHEV but lacks the combustion engine
                            component. Batteries and the electric drive are the sole source of propulsion for the BEV.
                            Replenishment is by plug-in only, and as previously stated, only when the vehicle is at rest
                            near an electrical source. Current BEVs arc best suited to short and mid range cycles of
                            operation (20 to 200 mile range) requiring recharging periods of several to many hours in
                            between excursions. A fourth category of sources for battery energy replenishment applicable
                            to HEV, PHEV, or BEV strategies includes all other electrical sources that can be
                            substituted for the grid as a plug-in source. For example, solar power from vehicle born or
                            stationary photovoltaic generators units can and has been demonstrated. Recent emphasis to
                            improve the practicality of BEVs has been placed upon faster recharging technology. For
                            example, Phoenix Motorcars of Ontario, Calif. and Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. of Reno,
                            Nev., U.S.A. report a BEV having 35 kWh (kilowatt-hour) battery energy with a 130 plus mile
                            range that can be recharged at a “fast charge station” in as less than 10 minutes. Several
                            hurdles challenge this approach, however. First and most importantly, the energy density,
                            both gravimetric (energy per unit weight) and volumetric (energy per unit volume) is
                            generally inversely related to a batteries maximum electrical current and power handling
                            capabilities. The higher the electrical discharge or charge current the battery can sustain,
                            the lower the energy density tends to be. The fast recharge time comes with the penalty of
                            heavier, larger, batteries and correspondingly reduced vehicle range. Secondly, a 10 minute
                            charge time for a 35 kWh battery implies electrical power requirements in excess of 230 kW,
                            perhaps 40-50 times or more greater than the typical residential electrical service in
                            total, which is why specially equipped “fast charge stations” are specified. Another
                            electric vehicle strategy is the Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV). The FCEV uses hydrogen
                            or other fuel cell technology produce electrical power for the electric motor propulsion
                            system. Although the FCEV strategy typically includes auxiliary electrical energy storage
                            subsystems in the form of either batteries or so-called “ultra-capacitors” for the purpose
                            of capturing regenerative braking energy and other electrical functions, the primary fuel
                            source is typically the fuel in the cells, such as compressed hydrogen, and refueling does
                            not typically involve recharging in the ordinary battery sense.

                        <td>It is in this context that embodiments of the invention arise. Embodiments are described
                            with reference to methods and systems for providing auxiliary charging mechanisms that can
                            be integrated or coupled to a vehicle, to supplement the main battery of a vehicle. The
                            auxiliary charging mechanism can be in the form of an auxiliary battery compartment that can
                            receive a plurality of charged batteries. The auxiliary battery compartment can be charged
                            without the vehicle, and can be installed or placed in the vehicle to provide supplemental
                            charge to the vehicles main battery. Thus, if the main battery becomes drained/used, the
                            auxiliary battery compartment, having a plurality of charged batteries, can resume providing
                            charge to the vehicle. In one embodiment, the auxiliary battery compartment is configured to
                            hold a plurality of smaller batteries, referred to herein as “volt bars.” A volt bar should
                            also be interchangeably viewed to be a “charge unit.” The charge unit is a physical
                            structure that holds charge, as does a battery. A charge unit can also be a fraction of
                            charge, which may be contained in a physical structure. Broadly speaking, a volt bar is a
                            battery that can be inserted into an auxiliary battery carrier. The auxiliary battery
                            carrier, or compartment, can be lifted by human and placed into a vehicle, such as the trunk
                            of the vehicle. The auxiliary charging carrier can then be removed from the vehicle to
                            provide charge to the volt bars contained within the auxiliary battery carrier. For
                            instance, owners of electric vehicles can purchase an auxiliary battery carrier and fill the
                            auxiliary battery carrier with a plurality of volt bars.

                        <td>One barrier to adoption of electric motors for vehicles is that electric motors tend to be
                            under-powered compared to their gasoline engine counterparts. Consequences of engine power
                            constraints for electric vehicles in particular include limiting their range before charging
                            is necessary, and hampering their usefulness in hilly areas or in off-road conditions. Thus,
                            to achieve a high market penetration of electric vehicles worldwide in the more remote
                            areas, and in areas with more challenging terrain, technological advances are needed to
                            improve the efficiency of power delivery for electric vehicles. A power delivery system for
                            an electric vehicle provides a long driving range and efficient power management for either
                            continuous or intermittent high-performance operation, using an auxiliary boost stage and an
                            on-board charging circuit. A main battery, configured as a high-capacity power source of
                            intermediate-level current, supplies power to the electric motor under normal load
                            conditions. The main battery can be augmented with an auxiliary boost battery that is
                            configured to supply, when needed, a high-level current at a higher discharge rate than the
                            discharge rate of the main battery, thereby causing the motor to operate in a
                            high-performance drive mode. The main battery can be removable for external charging, while
                            the boost battery can be charged from the main battery, during operation of the motor, via a
                            charging circuit that includes a low-cost DC/DC converter. Once the boost battery is
                            charged, the main battery and the boost battery can operate together to power the vehicle at
                            a high power discharge rate. The charging circuit provides a charge-balancing function that
                            allows the main battery and the boost battery to cooperate even if they have different
                            chemistries. If a light-weight battery such as a Lithium-ferrite battery is used for the
                            boost battery, the power delivery system can be particularly advantageous for personal
                            transport vehicles such as scooters or motorbikes. In one embodiment, a request for
                            participation of the boost battery in powering the electric motor can be made automatically
                            according to sensed changes in the load. In another embodiment, power management can be
                            based on timed intervals. FIG. 1 is an isometric, partially exploded view of an electric

                        <td>The Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is similar to the PHEV but lacks the combustion engine
                            component. Batteries and the electric drive are the sole source of propulsion for the BEV.
                            Replenishment is by plug-in only, and as previously stated, only when the vehicle is at rest
                            near an electrical source. Current BEVs are best suited to short and mid range cycles of
                            operation (20 to 200 mile range) requiring recharging periods of several to many hours in
                            between excursions. A fourth category of sources for battery energy replenishment applicable
                            to HEV, PHEV, or BEV strategies includes all other electrical sources that can be
                            substituted for the grid as a plug-in source. For example, solar power from vehicle born or
                            stationary photovoltaic generators units can and has been demonstrated. Recent emphasis to
                            improve the practicality of BEVs has been placed upon faster recharging technology. For
                            example, Phoenix Motorcars of Ontario, Calif. and Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. of Reno,
                            Nev., U.S.A. report a BEV having 35 kWh (kilowatt-hour) battery energy with a 130 plus mile
                            range that can be recharged at a “fast charge station” in as less than 10 minutes. Several
                            hurdles challenge this approach, however. First and most importantly, the energy density,
                            both gravimetric (energy per unit weight) and volumetric (energy per unit volume) is
                            generally inversely related to a batteries maximum electrical current and power handling
                            capabilities. The higher the electrical discharge or charge current the battery can sustain,
                            the lower the energy density tends to be. The fast recharge time comes with the penalty of
                            heavier, larger, batteries and correspondingly reduced vehicle range. Secondly, a 10 minute
                            charge time for a 35 kWh battery implies electrical power requirements in excess of 230 kW,
                            perhaps 40-50 times or more greater than the typical residential electrical service in
                            total, which is why specially equipped “fast charge stations” are specified. Another
                            electric vehicle strategy is the Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV). The FCEV uses hydrogen
                            or other fuel cell technology produce electrical power for the electric motor propulsion
                            system. Although the FCEV strategy typically includes auxiliary electrical energy storage
                            subsystems in the form of either batteries or so-called “ultra-capacitors” for the purpose
                            of capturing regenerative braking energy and other electrical functions, the primary fuel
                            source is typically the fuel in the cells, such as compressed hydrogen, and refueling does
                            not typically involve recharging in the ordinary battery sense.

                        <td>The Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is similar to the PHEV but lacks the combustion engine
                            component. Batteries and the electric drive are the sole source of propulsion for the BEV.
                            Replenishment is by plug-in only, and as previously stated, only when the vehicle is at rest
                            near an electrical source. Current BEVs are best suited to short and mid range cycles of
                            operation (20 to 200 mile range) requiring recharging periods of several to many hours in
                            between excursions. A fourth category of sources for battery energy replenishment applicable
                            to HEV, PHEV, or BEV strategies includes all other electrical sources that can be
                            substituted for the grid as a plug-in source. For example, solar power from vehicle born or
                            stationary photovoltaic generators units can and has been demonstrated. Recent emphasis to
                            improve the practicality of BEVs has been placed upon faster recharging technology. For
                            example, Phoenix Motorcars of Ontario, Calif. and Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. of Reno,
                            Nev., U.S.A. report a BEV having 35 kWh (kilowatt-hour) battery energy with a 130 plus mile
                            range that can be recharged at a “fast charge station” in as less than 10 minutes. Several
                            hurdles challenge this approach, however. First and most importantly, the energy density,

                            can be used and inter-exchanged in various applications. A modular battery pack can be used
                            as a building block to build larger battery packs that satisfy all sorts of power storage or
                            supply needs, such as interchangeable battery packs for different types of devices such as
                            electric vehicles of different models and/or from different manufacturers. This will largely
                            reduce the costs of designs and manufactures of different types of battery packs. This
                            technology would also significantly reduce the total battery demand to maintain global

                            a battery module that includes a plurality of modular battery packs. The modular battery
                            packs can be connected in series, in parallel, or the mix thereof depending on the power
                            supply needs of the electric vehicle. Each of the plurality modular battery packs can be
                            detached without affecting the normal functions of the electric vehicle. The number of
                            modular battery packs installed on the electric vehicle can be configured by the
                            manufacturer, retailer, and/or customer based on the customer's needs. Yet another object of
                            the present disclosure is to provide systems and methods of servicing electric vehicles with
                            modular battery packs. Battery swapping and/or renting stations allows electric vehicle
                            users to swapping batteries whose charges run low with fully charged batteries and/or to
                            rent additional batteries to temporary use. A centralized or distributed data system may be
                            used to track each modular battery pack's condition such use history, designed capacity,
                            capacity degrade, charge cycles, etc. The costs of battery swapping and/or renting or the
                            cost of the battery itself can thus be based on the historic operating conditions of the
                            modular battery packs. When the conditions of modular battery packs degrade, they can be
                            recycled and used for other applications that have low performance requirements of battery
                            packs, particularly with lower charging and discharging rates. For example, when the
                            condition of a modular battery pack used on an electric vehicle degrades to a certain level,
                            it can be recycled and used as energy storage purposes. The recycled modular battery pack
                            may be used together with other battery packs and connected to a power grid and be charged
                            with the redundant power from the power grid. And the electrical energy stored in these
                            modular battery packs can then be used to provide power to consumers, charge other battery
                            packs, etc.

                        <td>One viable solution is to encourage the use of electric personal transport vehicles,
                            including automobiles, motorcycles, golf carts, scooters, and the like, where they are
                            feasible. It is especially advantageous to promote the use of “clean energy” vehicles having
                            zero tail pipe emission in the most densely populated metropolitan areas of Asia, for
                            example, cities in China, Taiwan, Korea, and India. In the past, these areas have relied
                            successfully on the use of bicycles for personal transport, but have in recent years
                            replaced bicycles with combustion engine-powered vehicles. Substituting electric vehicles is
                            a way to reduce tail pipe emissions to zero while also lowering overall pollution, because
                            sources of electricity for recharging electric vehicles also tend to be clean energy
                            sources. For example, electrical power may be generated from renewable sources (e.g., solar,
                            hydro), or it may be generated at generation plants that produce no air pollution (e.g.,
                            nuclear plants). Also for example, electricity may be generated at plants that burn
                            relatively clean burning fuels (e.g., natural gas), which have higher efficiency than
                            internal combustion engines, and/or which employ pollution control or removal systems (e.g.,
                            industrial air scrubbers) which are too large, costly or expensive to install on board
                            individual vehicles. One barrier to adoption of electric motors for vehicles is that
                            electric motors tend to be under-powered compared to their gasoline engine counterparts.
                            Consequences of engine power constraints for electric vehicles in particular include
                            limiting their range before charging is necessary, and hampering their usefulness in hilly
                            areas or in off-road conditions. Thus, to achieve a high market penetration of electric
                            vehicles worldwide in the more remote areas, and in areas with more challenging terrain,
                            technological advances are needed to improve the efficiency of power delivery for electric
                            vehicles. A power delivery system for an electric vehicle provides a long driving range and
                            efficient power management for either continuous or intermittent high-performance operation,
                            using an auxiliary boost stage and an on-board charging circuit. A main battery, configured
                            as a high-capacity power source of intermediate-level current, supplies power to the
                            electric motor under normal load conditions. The main battery can be augmented with an
                            auxiliary boost battery that is configured to supply, when needed, a high-level current at a
                            higher discharge rate than the discharge rate of the main battery, thereby causing the motor
                            to operate in a high-performance drive mode. The main battery can be removable for external
                            charging, while the boost battery can be charged from the main battery, during operation of
                            the motor, via a charging circuit that includes a low-cost DC/DC converter. Once the boost
                            battery is charged, the main battery and the boost battery can operate together to power the
                            vehicle at a high power discharge rate. The charging circuit provides a charge-balancing
                            function that allows the main battery and the boost battery to cooperate even if they have
                            different chemistries. If a light-weight battery such as a Lithium-ferrite battery is used
                            for the boost battery, the power delivery system can be particularly advantageous for
                            personal transport vehicles such as scooters or motorbikes. In one embodiment, a request for
                            participation of the boost battery in powering the electric motor can be made automatically
                            according to sensed changes in the load. In another embodiment, power management can be
                            based on timed intervals. FIG. 1 is an isometric, partially exploded view of an electric

                            predicts, based on the event data received from the mobile device, a time period when the
                            vehicle will be parked at the destination. The battery status prediction module predicts a
                            predicted battery status at the end of the time period based on a temperature profile for
                            the time period. The vehicle includes a radiofrequency transceiver communicatively connected
                            to the battery monitoring system to obtain the temperature profile from a remote weather
                            server for the time period when the vehicle will be parked. The battery status prediction
                            module determines if the predicted battery status at the end of the time period will have at
                            least a minimum battery capacity to travel a distance to a charging station determined by
                            the battery status prediction module from the destination and a location of the charging
                            station. The battery status prediction module, if the predicted battery status is below the
                            minimum battery capacity, outputs an alert to the user that the predicted battery capacity
                            at the end of the time period is insufficient to travel the distance to the charging
                            station. The foregoing presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a
                            basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an exhaustive
                            overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify essential, key or critical

                        <td>The present disclosure also describes a rechargeable battery for a light electric vehicle.
                            The rechargeable battery includes a housing having a first side and a second side. The first
                            side of the housing defines a first channel that extends substantially along a length of the
                            first side of the housing. The first channel receives a pivot mechanism of a rechargeable
                            battery holster when the rechargeable battery is positioned in a first orientation. The
                            first channel engages the pivot mechanism as the rechargeable battery pivots around the
                            pivot mechanism. For example, as the rechargeable battery is moved from the first
                            orientation to a second orientation, an inner sidewall of the channel engages with one or
                            more outer sidewalls of the pivot mechanism. The second side of the housing defines a second
                            channel. The second channel engages a locking mechanism of the rechargeable battery holster
                            when the rechargeable battery reaches the second orientation. Also described is a holster
                            for a rechargeable battery. In some examples, the holster includes a base portion and a
                            pivot mechanism positioned on the base portion. The pivot mechanism engages a first channel
                            of a rechargeable battery when the rechargeable battery is in a first orientation. The
                            holster also includes a body portion extending from the base portion. The locking mechanism
                            engages a second channel of the rechargeable battery when the rechargeable battery rotates
                            around the pivot mechanism as the rechargeable battery moves from the first orientation to a
                            second orientation. This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a

                            GB2460500, to Mayer et al., discloses a system for improved and more efficient recharging of
                            electric cars, by using improved batteries, improved recharger arrangements in electric
                            cars, and infrastructures that are used for recharging electric cars, while also protecting
                            the electric grid from overload. This is done for example by accumulating energy in service
                            stations in special high speed capacitors, such as one or more super capacitors, or one or
                            more molten salt accumulators, or other fast batteries which can be recharged to 80 percent
                            capacity within 5 minutes. These accumulators can be used to recharge cars, since otherwise
                            the service station would need to have a huge capacity power supply to enable such fast
                            recharges. Other variations include efficient methods of recharging the batteries serially,
                            either in the service station (based on a model of fast replacement of batteries at the
                            service station), after automatically sorting the batteries into more or less homogenous
                            groups, or in the car itself by automatically rerouting the batteries, or some of them, or
                            elements in them, during recharge so that they are recharged more serially than during the
                            normal operation of the car. This enables recharge with fewer rechargers at higher voltages
                            and with less current and fewer problems of heat during recharge. Other improvements include
                            a system wherein when recharging the electric cars, rechargers and central computers in the
                            electrical grid company and in the service provider take into account car-specific
                            parameters in order to optimize the recharging priorities, for example based on the state of
                            their batteries and heuristics or statistics or automatic repeated identification of cars
                            based on a unique digital ID number. The system can take into account also various regular
                            or historical car-specific parameters or patterns or statistics, such as typical arrival and
                            departure times, typical distances traveled, specific needs based on week days, etc. Other
                            features include a system and method for alerting users when a parking and recharging post
                            becomes available or reserving them in advance. French Patent Application Publication No.

                        <td>The present disclosure also describes a rechargeable battery for a light electric vehicle.
                            The rechargeable battery includes a housing having a first side and a second side. The first
                            side of the housing defines a first channel that extends substantially along a length of the
                            first side of the housing. The first channel receives a pivot mechanism of a rechargeable
                            battery holster when the rechargeable battery is positioned in a first orientation. The
                            first channel engages the pivot mechanism as the rechargeable battery pivots around the
                            pivot mechanism. For example, as the rechargeable battery is moved from the first
                            orientation to a second orientation, an inner sidewall of the channel engages with one or
                            more outer sidewalls of the pivot mechanism. The second side of the housing defines a second
                            channel. The second channel engages a locking mechanism of the rechargeable battery holster
                            when the rechargeable battery reaches the second orientation. Also described is a holster
                            for a rechargeable battery. In some examples, the holster includes a base portion and a
                            pivot mechanism positioned on the base portion. The pivot mechanism engages a first channel
                            of a rechargeable battery when the rechargeable battery is in a first orientation. The
                            holster also includes a body portion extending from the base portion. The locking mechanism
                            engages a second channel of the rechargeable battery when the rechargeable battery rotates
                            around the pivot mechanism as the rechargeable battery moves from the first orientation to a
                            second orientation. This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a
                            simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary

                        <td>As described above, not only is the electric vehicle put in storage after being delivered to
                            the user, but the electric vehicle may be stored as a stock item before being delivered to
                            the user. The charging technique of Patent Literature 1 is intended only for the storage
                            after the product is delivered to the user. However, if the charging technique of Patent
                            Literature 1 is applied to inventory management of electric vehicles, in this case, battery
                            chargers need to be always connected to a large number of batteries, respectively, in a
                            state where each battery is mounted to a corresponding vehicle body. Therefore, the
                            inventory management of the electric vehicles becomes very complex and cumbersome. In view
                            of the above, an object of the present invention is to facilitate inventory management of
                            electric vehicles. An electric vehicle according to the present invention includes: a
                            vehicle body including a wheel and an electric motor configured to drive rotation of the
                            wheel; and a battery pack mounted to the vehicle body. The vehicle body includes: a
                            vehicle-body-side power feeding connector configured to supply electric power to the
                            electric motor; and a vehicle control unit configured to control the electric motor. The
                            vehicle body can run when electric power is supplied to the electric motor from the
                            vehicle-body-side power feeding connector. The battery pack includes: a casing removably
                            mounted to the vehicle body; a battery accommodated in the casing and serving as a power
                            supply for the electric motor; a running-phase power feeding connector provided on the
                            casing, electrically connected to the battery, and electrically connectable to the
                            vehicle-body-side power feeding connector in a state where the casing is mounted to the
                            vehicle body; an in-storage charging connector provided on the casing, disposed at a
                            position different from that of the running-phase power feeding connector, electrically
                            connected to the battery, and electrically connectable to an external power supply; and a
                            battery monitoring unit accommodated in the casing and configured to monitor a state of the
                            battery. According to the above configuration, even in a state where the battery pack is
                            removed from the vehicle body, the vehicle body becomes able to run when an external power
                            supply is connected to the vehicle-body-side power feeding connector and electric power is
                            thereby supplied to the electric motor. Therefore, even in a state where the battery pack is
                            removed from the vehicle body, a running test of the vehicle body can be performed on a test
                            bench with the vehicle control unit in operation. The in-storage charging connector is
                            provided on the casing, and the battery monitoring unit is accommodated in the casing. By
                            using the connector and the unit, even in a state where the battery pack is removed from the
                            vehicle body, charge/discharge tests of the battery can be performed without removing the
                            battery from the battery pack.

                        <td>One such system known in the art discloses dedicated battery-switching stations that power
                            the exchange of a depleted battery with a freshly charged battery. The system requires
                            vehicles with batteries located underneath the vehicle. The vehicle drives up a ramp and is
                            aligned with a battery shuttle mechanism within a switching area of the station. Once the
                            vehicle is stopped and turned off in the switching area, a battery shuttle engages from
                            underneath the vehicle and rises up toward the bottom of the vehicle. The shuttle makes
                            contact with the depleted battery in the vehicle. Once it makes contact, the shuttle
                            releases the battery, removes it and moves it away from the vehicle. After the depleted
                            battery is completed removed and away from the vehicle, the system installs a new charged
                            battery into the vehicle. The depleted battery is then recharged for further use. Another
                            system known in the art discloses a battery transfer and charging system for electric
                            vehicles with a displacement station that removes used batteries by forcing charged
                            batteries into position within the vehicle so as to laterally displace the used batteries.
                            The electric vehicle drives into the displacement station and stops at a specified location
                            for the battery removal and installation in either a horizontal or vertical manner. While
                            the vehicle is stopped and in the displacement station, the displacement station powers the
                            removal of the used battery and replacement with a charged battery utilizing a hydraulic ram
                            to forcefully displace the used battery. Still another system known in the art discloses a
                            service center whereby an electric vehicle is driven into the service center that powers a
                            battery exchange. Once the vehicle is stopped in the service center and shut off, the system
                            unlocks the depleted battery from the vehicle and removes it vertically downward from the
                            vehicle utilizing lifting means located in a pit of the service center beneath the vehicle.
                            After the depleted battery is completely removed from the vehicle, similar to other known
                            systems, the system installs a charged battery into the vehicle utilizing lifting means that
                            lift the battery into place. The battery is then locked into position and the vehicle is
                            ready for further driving. In view of the foregoing and the limitations on known electric
                            vehicle battery exchange systems, there is a need for an improved battery exchange system
                            for the exchange of batteries in electric vehicles whereby an electric vehicle is moved
                            through the exchange system to rapidly replace a depleted battery located in a battery bay
                            in the vehicle's undercarriage with a charged replacement battery. During the exchange, the
                            vehicle slowly moves forward through the exchange system. The vehicle may propel itself or
                            may be propelled by the system. The depleted battery need not be completely removed prior to
                            installation of the charged replacement battery. Further, the vehicle may remain powered
                            during part or all of the exchange process as the charged replacement battery replaces the
                            depleted battery in contact with the vehicle.

                        <td>It is in this context that embodiments of the invention arise. Embodiments are described
                            with reference to methods and systems for providing auxiliary charging mechanisms that can
                            be integrated or coupled to a vehicle, to supplement the main battery of a vehicle. The
                            auxiliary charging mechanism can be in the form of an auxiliary battery compartment that can
                            receive a plurality of charged batteries. The auxiliary battery compartment can be charged
                            without the vehicle, and can be installed or placed in the vehicle to provide supplemental
                            charge to the vehicles main battery. Thus, if the main battery becomes drained/used, the
                            auxiliary battery compartment, having a plurality of charged batteries, can resume providing
                            charge to the vehicle. In one embodiment, the auxiliary battery compartment is configured to
                            hold a plurality of smaller batteries, referred to herein as “volt bars.” A volt bar should
                            also be interchangeably viewed to be a “charge unit.” The charge unit is a physical
                            structure that holds charge, as does a battery. A charge unit can also be a fraction of
                            charge, which may be contained in a physical structure. Broadly speaking, a volt bar is a
                            battery that can be inserted into an auxiliary battery carrier. The auxiliary battery
                            carrier, or compartment, can be lifted by human and placed into a vehicle, such as the trunk
                            of the vehicle. The auxiliary charging carrier can then be removed from the vehicle to
                            provide charge to the volt bars contained within the auxiliary battery carrier. For
                            instance, owners of electric vehicles can purchase an auxiliary battery carrier and fill the
                            auxiliary battery carrier with a plurality of volt bars.

                        <td>It should be understood that there are deficiencies to the above-described conventional
                            electric vehicles which run on power from lead acid batteries. Along these lines, lead acid
                            batteries are inferior to lithium batteries from certain perspectives. For example, lead
                            acid batteries tend to weigh more, have shorter cycle life, and provide less consistent
                            voltage, among other things. Unfortunately, it would be unsafe to simply substitute lithium
                            batteries in place of lead acid batteries. For example, if one were to simply replace a lead
                            acid battery with a lithium battery in an electric vehicle, it may be possible to deeply
                            discharge and then recharge the lithium battery. However, recharging a lithium battery that
                            has been over-discharged may make the lithium battery unstable and thus susceptible to a
                            hazardous event. Improved techniques are directed to electronically controlling electrical
                            access to lithium batteries on utility vehicles. Such techniques provide the ability to
                            automatically disconnect the lithium batteries from loads in response to certain situations
                            such as fault conditions, timeouts, and sleep events. Such operation prevents the lithium
                            batteries from discharging even due to parasitic loads while the utility vehicles are idle.
                            As a result, such operation robustly and reliably prevents the lithium batteries from being
                            recharged after being over-discharged and thus safeguards the lithium batteries against
                            becoming unstable. One embodiment is directed to a battery management system that controls
                            lithium battery access on a utility vehicle. The battery management system includes a
                            lithium battery interface configured to couple to a lithium battery, a power delivery
                            interface configured to couple to a set of loads of the utility vehicle, and control
                            circuitry coupled with the lithium battery interface and the power delivery interface. The
                            control circuitry is configured to mechanically disconnect the lithium battery interface
                            from the power delivery interface in response to a sleep event. The control circuitry is
                            further configured to, after the lithium battery interface is mechanically disconnected from
                            the power delivery interface, mechanically reconnect the lithium battery interface to the
                            power delivery interface in response to a wakeup event. The control circuitry is configured
                            to, after the lithium battery interface is mechanically reconnected to the power delivery
                            interface, maintain connection between the lithium battery interface and the power delivery
                            interface to convey power from the lithium battery to the set of loads of the utility
                            vehicle through the lithium battery interface and the power delivery interface.

                        <td>The Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is similar to the PHEV but lacks the combustion engine
                            component. Batteries and the electric drive are the sole source of propulsion for the BEV.
                            Replenishment is by plug-in only, and as previously stated, only when the vehicle is at rest
                            near an electrical source. Current BEVs arc best suited to short and mid range cycles of
                            operation (20 to 200 mile range) requiring recharging periods of several to many hours in
                            between excursions. A fourth category of sources for battery energy replenishment applicable
                            to HEV, PHEV, or BEV strategies includes all other electrical sources that can be
                            substituted for the grid as a plug-in source. For example, solar power from vehicle born or
                            stationary photovoltaic generators units can and has been demonstrated. Recent emphasis to
                            improve the practicality of BEVs has been placed upon faster recharging technology. For
                            example, Phoenix Motorcars of Ontario, Calif. and Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. of Reno,
                            Nev., U.S.A. report a BEV having 35 kWh (kilowatt-hour) battery energy with a 130 plus mile
                            range that can be recharged at a “fast charge station” in as less than 10 minutes. Several
                            hurdles challenge this approach, however. First and most importantly, the energy density,
                            both gravimetric (energy per unit weight) and volumetric (energy per unit volume) is
                            generally inversely related to a batteries maximum electrical current and power handling
                            capabilities. The higher the electrical discharge or charge current the battery can sustain,
                            the lower the energy density tends to be. The fast recharge time comes with the penalty of
                            heavier, larger, batteries and correspondingly reduced vehicle range. Secondly, a 10 minute
                            charge time for a 35 kWh battery implies electrical power requirements in excess of 230 kW,
                            perhaps 40-50 times or more greater than the typical residential electrical service in
                            total, which is why specially equipped “fast charge stations” are specified. Another
                            electric vehicle strategy is the Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV). The FCEV uses hydrogen
                            or other fuel cell technology produce electrical power for the electric motor propulsion
                            system. Although the FCEV strategy typically includes auxiliary electrical energy storage
                            subsystems in the form of either batteries or so-called “ultra-capacitors” for the purpose
                            of capturing regenerative braking energy and other electrical functions, the primary fuel
                            source is typically the fuel in the cells, such as compressed hydrogen, and refueling does
                            not typically involve recharging in the ordinary battery sense.

                        <td>The present invention is useful not only for purely electrically powered vehicles but also
                            in the case of hybrid vehicles in which the user can freely select the powering mode. In
                            fact, the user may prefer electric power in certain cases, especially for urban traffic or
                            other zones in which the exhaust gases may be harmful, and the user has means for charging
                            the battery in these situations without having to operate the internal combustion engine. It
                            is recalled here that a hybrid vehicle comprises, on the one hand, a conventional internal
                            combustion engine and, on the other hand, an electric motor supplied by a storage battery.
                            The battery is charged when the vehicle is being powered by the internal combustion engine.
                            The internal combustion engine drives the electric motor in this case, which operates now as
                            a generator and charges the battery. Such a vehicle comprises a means for automatic power
                            management, which gives priority to the electric power when the battery is sufficiently
                            charged and to the internal combustion engine above a certain rate of speed. By contrast,
                            when the state of charge of the battery is not sufficient, the internal combustion engine is
                            systematically put into operation partly to ensure the powering and partly to charge the
                            battery. It shall also be recalled that a power mode management for hybrid vehicles has
                            already been provided, which comprises a switching means that can be actuated by the driver,
                            which enables him to choose between an automatic management mode and a manual management
                            mode offering the choice between the mode of powering by means of the internal combustion
                            engine and the mode of powering by means of the electric motor.

                        <td>It is in this context that embodiments of the invention arise. Embodiments are described
                            with reference to methods and systems for providing auxiliary charging mechanisms that can
                            be integrated or coupled to a vehicle, to supplement the main battery of a vehicle. The
                            auxiliary charging mechanism can be in the form of an auxiliary battery compartment that can
                            receive a plurality of charged batteries. The auxiliary battery compartment can be charged
                            without the vehicle, and can be installed or placed in the vehicle to provide supplemental
                            charge to the vehicles main battery. Thus, if the main battery becomes drained/used, the
                            auxiliary battery compartment, having a plurality of charged batteries, can resume providing
                            charge to the vehicle. In one embodiment, the auxiliary battery compartment is configured to
                            hold a plurality of smaller batteries, referred to herein as “volt bars.” A volt bar should
                            also be interchangeably viewed to be a “charge unit.” The charge unit is a physical
                            structure that holds charge, as does a battery. A charge unit can also be a fraction of
                            charge, which may be contained in a physical structure. Broadly speaking, a volt bar is a
                            battery that can be inserted into an auxiliary battery carrier. The auxiliary battery
                            carrier, or compartment, can be lifted by human and placed into a vehicle, such as the trunk
                            of the vehicle. The auxiliary charging carrier can then be removed from the vehicle to
                            provide charge to the volt bars contained within the auxiliary battery carrier. For
                            instance, owners of electric vehicles can purchase an auxiliary battery carrier and fill the
                            auxiliary battery carrier with a plurality of volt bars.

                        <td>The Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is similar to the PHEV but lacks the combustion engine
                            component. Batteries and the electric drive are the sole source of propulsion for the BEV.
                            Replenishment is by plug-in only, and as previously stated, only when the vehicle is at rest
                            near an electrical source. Current BEVs are best suited to short and mid range cycles of
                            operation (20 to 200 mile range) requiring recharging periods of several to many hours in
                            between excursions. A fourth category of sources for battery energy replenishment applicable
                            to HEV, PHEV, or BEV strategies includes all other electrical sources that can be
                            substituted for the grid as a plug-in source. For example, solar power from vehicle born or
                            stationary photovoltaic generators units can and has been demonstrated. Recent emphasis to
                            improve the practicality of BEVs has been placed upon faster recharging technology. For
                            example, Phoenix Motorcars of Ontario, Calif. and Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. of Reno,
                            Nev., U.S.A. report a BEV having 35 kWh (kilowatt-hour) battery energy with a 130 plus mile
                            range that can be recharged at a “fast charge station” in as less than 10 minutes. Several
                            hurdles challenge this approach, however. First and most importantly, the energy density,
                            both gravimetric (energy per unit weight) and volumetric (energy per unit volume) is
                            generally inversely related to a batteries maximum electrical current and power handling
                            capabilities. The higher the electrical discharge or charge current the battery can sustain,
                            the lower the energy density tends to be. The fast recharge time comes with the penalty of
                            heavier, larger, batteries and correspondingly reduced vehicle range. Secondly, a 10 minute
                            charge time for a 35 kWh battery implies electrical power requirements in excess of 230 kW,
                            perhaps 40-50 times or more greater than the typical residential electrical service in
                            total, which is why specially equipped “fast charge stations” are specified. Another
                            electric vehicle strategy is the Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV). The FCEV uses hydrogen
                            or other fuel cell technology produce electrical power for the electric motor propulsion
                            system. Although the FCEV strategy typically includes auxiliary electrical energy storage
                            subsystems in the form of either batteries or so-called “ultra-capacitors” for the purpose
                            of capturing regenerative braking energy and other electrical functions, the primary fuel
                            source is typically the fuel in the cells, such as compressed hydrogen, and refueling does
                            not typically involve recharging in the ordinary battery sense.

                        <td>Perhaps the biggest problem with the currently-available, non-combustion cars, relates to
                            regeneration of the source of power, the internal batteries. Most of these internal car
                            batteries must be regenerated, or recharged daily. The process of recharging the batteries
                            is frequently cumbersome and time consuming. The recharging process takes many hours, and
                            the recharging of the batteries must be done at some designated recharging stations, or at
                            the driver's home. The defined-above recharging requirements lead to the main issue
                            confronting today's non-combustion cars is the travel range (or the limited distance the car
                            can travel, before the recharging process of its battery must be reinitiated). Most cars
                            currently on the market, have the travel range of 150 miles to approximately 300 miles. This
                            range may be sufficient for typical inner-city commutes, but it would be quite insufficient
                            for cross-country, family trips. The present invention addresses the above-defined
                            shortcomings of the non-combustive electric vehicles, by introducing a self-rechargeable,
                            electric vehicle. A vehicle that converts the mechanical energy generated by the rotation of
                            its wheels, into direct current, recycled to continuously recharge its primary source of
                            propulsion, the onboard, lithium-ion battery system. The following information is intended
                            to be a brief summary of the invention, and as such, said information shall not be used as

                        <td>The inventor of the present disclosure has focused attention on the fact that the following
                            problem may occur. Generally, an electrically-powered vehicle can take a state in which
                            electric power is supplied from an assembled battery to a motor and the vehicle can travel
                            (ReadyON state), and a state in which electric power supply from the assembled battery to
                            the motor is blocked and the vehicle cannot travel (ReadyOFF state). It is also assumed that
                            the vehicle is in a traveling-impossible state for a long period of time, such as the
                            vehicle being left unattended for several months. During this period, self-discharge of an
                            auxiliary battery progresses gradually. Therefore, electric power stored in the auxiliary
                            battery can possibly decrease excessively and the function of the auxiliary device cannot
                            possibly be maintained. The present disclosure has been made to solve the above-described
                            problem and an object of the present disclosure is to make it possible to effectively
                            utilize electric power in equalization control and supply electric power required for an
                            auxiliary device for a long period of time. (1) A battery system according to an aspect of

                            auxiliary battery that supplies electric power to the auxiliary device; and an assembled
                            battery that supplies electric power to the motor. The assembled battery includes a
                            plurality of blocks connected in series. Each of the plurality of blocks includes a
                            plurality of cells connected in series. The battery system further includes: a plurality of
                            converters that each converts electric power between a corresponding one of the plurality of
                            blocks and the auxiliary battery, the plurality of converters being provided to correspond
                            to the plurality of blocks; and a controller that executes first equalization control when
                            the electrically-powered vehicle is in a traveling-possible state, and executes second

                            state. The first equalization control is control for, when voltage variations among the
                            plurality of blocks exceed a first threshold value, operating a converter corresponding to a
                            lower-voltage block, of at least one pair of blocks having the voltage variations exceeding
                            the first threshold value, such that the lower-voltage block is charged with electric power
                            supplied from the auxiliary battery. The second equalization control is control for, when
                            the voltage variations among the plurality of blocks exceed a second threshold value,
                            operating a converter corresponding to a higher-voltage block, of at least one pair of

                        <td>As described above, not only is the electric vehicle put in storage after being delivered to
                            the user, but the electric vehicle may be stored as a stock item before being delivered to
                            the user. The charging technique of Patent Literature 1 is intended only for the storage
                            after the product is delivered to the user. However, if the charging technique of Patent
                            Literature 1 is applied to inventory management of electric vehicles, in this case, battery
                            chargers need to be always connected to a large number of batteries, respectively, in a
                            state where each battery is mounted to a corresponding vehicle body. Therefore, the
                            inventory management of the electric vehicles becomes very complex and cumbersome. In view
                            of the above, an object of the present invention is to facilitate inventory management of
                            electric vehicles. An electric vehicle according to the present invention includes: a
                            vehicle body including a wheel and an electric motor configured to drive rotation of the
                            wheel; and a battery pack mounted to the vehicle body. The vehicle body includes: a
                            vehicle-body-side power feeding connector configured to supply electric power to the
                            electric motor; and a vehicle control unit configured to control the electric motor. The
                            vehicle body can run when electric power is supplied to the electric motor from the
                            vehicle-body-side power feeding connector. The battery pack includes: a casing removably
                            mounted to the vehicle body; a battery accommodated in the casing and serving as a power
                            supply for the electric motor; a running-phase power feeding connector provided on the
                            casing, electrically connected to the battery, and electrically connectable to the
                            vehicle-body-side power feeding connector in a state where the casing is mounted to the
                            vehicle body; an in-storage charging connector provided on the casing, disposed at a
                            position different from that of the running-phase power feeding connector, electrically
                            connected to the battery, and electrically connectable to an external power supply; and a
                            battery monitoring unit accommodated in the casing and configured to monitor a state of the
                            battery. According to the above configuration, even in a state where the battery pack is
                            removed from the vehicle body, the vehicle body becomes able to run when an external power
                            supply is connected to the vehicle-body-side power feeding connector and electric power is
                            thereby supplied to the electric motor. Therefore, even in a state where the battery pack is
                            removed from the vehicle body, a running test of the vehicle body can be performed on a test
                            bench with the vehicle control unit in operation. The in-storage charging connector is
                            provided on the casing, and the battery monitoring unit is accommodated in the casing. By
                            using the connector and the unit, even in a state where the battery pack is removed from the
                            vehicle body, charge/discharge tests of the battery can be performed without removing the
                            battery from the battery pack.

                        <td>It is in this context that embodiments of the invention arise. Embodiments are described
                            with reference to methods and systems for providing auxiliary charging mechanisms that can
                            be integrated or coupled to a vehicle, to supplement the main battery of a vehicle. The
                            auxiliary charging mechanism can be in the form of an auxiliary battery compartment that can
                            receive a plurality of charged batteries. The auxiliary battery compartment can be charged
                            without the vehicle, and can be installed or placed in the vehicle to provide supplemental
                            charge to the vehicles main battery. Thus, if the main battery becomes drained/used, the
                            auxiliary battery compartment, having a plurality of charged batteries, can resume providing
                            charge to the vehicle. In one embodiment, the auxiliary battery compartment is configured to
                            hold a plurality of smaller batteries, referred to herein as “volt bars.” A volt bar should
                            also be interchangeably viewed to be a “charge unit.” The charge unit is a physical
                            structure that holds charge, as does a battery. A charge unit can also be a fraction of
                            charge, which may be contained in a physical structure. Broadly speaking, a volt bar is a
                            battery that can be inserted into an auxiliary battery carrier. The auxiliary battery
                            carrier, or compartment, can be lifted by human and placed into a vehicle, such as the trunk
                            of the vehicle. The auxiliary charging carrier can then be removed from the vehicle to
                            provide charge to the volt bars contained within the auxiliary battery carrier. For
                            instance, owners of electric vehicles can purchase an auxiliary battery carrier and fill the
                            auxiliary battery carrier with a plurality of volt bars.

                        <td>It is in this context that embodiments of the invention arise. Embodiments are described
                            with reference to methods and systems for providing auxiliary charging mechanisms that can
                            be integrated or coupled to a vehicle, to supplement the main battery of a vehicle. The
                            auxiliary charging mechanism can be in the form of an auxiliary battery compartment that can
                            receive a plurality of charged batteries. The auxiliary battery compartment can be charged
                            without the vehicle, and can be installed or placed in the vehicle to provide supplemental
                            charge to the vehicles main battery. Thus, if the main battery becomes drained/used, the
                            auxiliary battery compartment, having a plurality of charged batteries, can resume providing
                            charge to the vehicle. In one embodiment, the auxiliary battery compartment is configured to
                            hold a plurality of smaller batteries, referred to herein as “volt bars.” A volt bar should
                            also be interchangeably viewed to be a “charge unit.” The charge unit is a physical
                            structure that holds charge, as does a battery. A charge unit can also be a fraction of
                            charge, which may be contained in a physical structure. Broadly speaking, a volt bar is a
                            battery that can be inserted into an auxiliary battery carrier. The auxiliary battery
                            carrier, or compartment, can be lifted by human and placed into a vehicle, such as the trunk
                            of the vehicle. The auxiliary charging carrier can then be removed from the vehicle to
                            provide charge to the volt bars contained within the auxiliary battery carrier. For
                            instance, owners of electric vehicles can purchase an auxiliary battery carrier and fill the
                            auxiliary battery carrier with a plurality of volt bars.

                        <td>The Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is similar to the PHEV but lacks the combustion engine
                            component. Batteries and the electric drive are the sole source of propulsion for the BEV.
                            Replenishment is by plug-in only, and as previously stated, only when the vehicle is at rest
                            near an electrical source. Current BEVs are best suited to short and mid range cycles of
                            operation (20 to 200 mile range) requiring recharging periods of several to many hours in
                            between excursions. A fourth category of sources for battery energy replenishment applicable
                            to HEV, PHEV, or BEV strategies includes all other electrical sources that can be
                            substituted for the grid as a plug-in source. For example, solar power from vehicle born or
                            stationary photovoltaic generators units can and has been demonstrated. Recent emphasis to
                            improve the practicality of BEVs has been placed upon faster recharging technology. For
                            example, Phoenix Motorcars of Ontario, Calif. and Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. of Reno,
                            Nev., U.S.A. report a BEV having 35 kWh (kilowatt-hour) battery energy with a 130 plus mile
                            range that can be recharged at a “fast charge station” in as less than 10 minutes. Several
                            hurdles challenge this approach, however. First and most importantly, the energy density,
                            both gravimetric (energy per unit weight) and volumetric (energy per unit volume) is
                            generally inversely related to a batteries maximum electrical current and power handling
                            capabilities. The higher the electrical discharge or charge current the battery can sustain,
                            the lower the energy density tends to be. The fast recharge time comes with the penalty of
                            heavier, larger, batteries and correspondingly reduced vehicle range. Secondly, a 10 minute
                            charge time for a 35 kWh battery implies electrical power requirements in excess of 230 kW,
                            perhaps 40-50 times or more greater than the typical residential electrical service in
                            total, which is why specially equipped “fast charge stations” are specified. Another
                            electric vehicle strategy is the Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV). The FCEV uses hydrogen
                            or other fuel cell technology produce electrical power for the electric motor propulsion
                            system. Although the FCEV strategy typically includes auxiliary electrical energy storage
                            subsystems in the form of either batteries or so-called “ultra-capacitors” for the purpose
                            of capturing regenerative braking energy and other electrical functions, the primary fuel
                            source is typically the fuel in the cells, such as compressed hydrogen, and refueling does
                            not typically involve recharging in the ordinary battery sense.

                        <td>In order to overcome the above described drawbacks, a network of charge spots and battery
                            exchange stations are deployed to provide the EV (electric vehicle) user with the ability to
                            keep his or her vehicle charged and available for use at all times. Some embodiments provide
                            a system and method to quickly exchange, a spent depleted (or substantially discharged)
                            battery pack for a fully charged (or substantially fully charged) battery pack at a battery
                            exchange station. The quick exchange is performed in a period of time significantly less
                            than that required to recharge a battery. Thus, the long battery recharge time may no longer
                            be relevant to a user of an electric vehicle who is traveling beyond the range of the
                            battery. Furthermore, the cost of the electric vehicle can be substantially reduced because
                            the battery of the electric vehicle can be separated from the initial cost of the vehicle.
                            For example, the battery can be owned by a party other than the user of the vehicle, such as
                            a financial institution or a service provider. These concepts are explained in more detail
                            in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/234,591, filed Sep. 19, 2008, entitled Electronic
                            Vehicle Network, incorporated herein by reference. Thus, the batteries may be treated as
                            components of the electric recharge grid (ERG) infrastructure to be monetized over a long
                            period of time, and not a part of the vehicle purchased by the consumer. The following
                            provides a detailed description of a system and method for swapping-out or replacing battery
                            packs in electric vehicles. Some embodiments provide a description of the quick exchangeable
                            battery packs attached to the vehicle. Some embodiments provide a battery bay configured to
                            be disposed at an underside of an at least partially electric vehicle. The battery bay
                            includes a frame that defines a cavity configured to at least partially receive a battery
                            pack therein. In some embodiments, the frame of the battery bay forms part of the structure
                            of the vehicle body and is not a separate component. The battery bay also includes at least
                            one latch mechanism rotatably pivoted about an axis substantially parallel with a plane
                            formed by an underside of the vehicle (and/or the surface on which the vehicle is configured
                            to travel, e.g., the road). The latch mechanism is configured to retain the battery pack at

                        <td>It is in this context that embodiments of the invention arise. Embodiments are described
                            with reference to methods and systems for providing auxiliary charging mechanisms that can
                            be integrated or coupled to a vehicle, to supplement the main battery of a vehicle. The
                            auxiliary charging mechanism can be in the form of an auxiliary battery compartment that can
                            receive a plurality of charged batteries. The auxiliary battery compartment can be charged
                            without the vehicle, and can be installed or placed in the vehicle to provide supplemental
                            charge to the vehicles main battery. Thus, if the main battery becomes drained/used, the
                            auxiliary battery compartment, having a plurality of charged batteries, can resume providing
                            charge to the vehicle. In one embodiment, the auxiliary battery compartment is configured to
                            hold a plurality of smaller batteries, referred to herein as “volt bars.” A volt bar should
                            also be interchangeably viewed to be a “charge unit.” The charge unit is a physical
                            structure that holds charge, as does a battery. A charge unit can also be a fraction of
                            charge, which may be contained in a physical structure. Broadly speaking, a volt bar is a
                            battery that can be inserted into an auxiliary battery carrier. The auxiliary battery
                            carrier, or compartment, can be lifted by human and placed into a vehicle, such as the trunk
                            of the vehicle. The auxiliary charging carrier can then be removed from the vehicle to
                            provide charge to the volt bars contained within the auxiliary battery carrier. For
                            instance, owners of electric vehicles can purchase an auxiliary battery carrier and fill the
                            auxiliary battery carrier with a plurality of volt bars.
